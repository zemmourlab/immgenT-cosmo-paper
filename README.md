# immgenT-cosmo-paper

Analysis code for *immgenT: A Comprehensive Reference of Convergent T-cell
States in the Mouse* ([bioRxiv 10.64898/2026.01.30.702892](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.30.702892v3)):
an atlas of 682,935 mouse T cells from 734 samples across 80 experiments,
profiled by single-cell RNA-seq, 128-plex CITE-seq and paired αβ TCR
sequencing, and organised into eight lineages and 107 reproducible clusters.

**Site: <https://zemmourlab.github.io/immgenT-cosmo-paper/>** — one page per
published figure, showing for each panel the code that produced it, the panel
itself, and a caption.

## Layout

- `analysis/` — the [workflowr](https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/) site
  source, one page per figure. Build with `workflowr::wflow_build()`; output
  goes to `docs/`.
- `script/` — one R script per published figure
  (`Rscript script/FigureN.R`), writing one PDF per panel into
  `figures/<figure>/`. See `script/README.md` for the figure → script map and
  the note on figure numbering.
- `code/R/` — shared plotting and data-loading helpers, sourced by the figure
  scripts. `code/pipeline/` — the slow upstream steps that produced the cached
  inputs, kept as provenance rather than as a rebuild. See `code/README.md`,
  which also carries the data provenance table.
- `figures/` — the panel set, one PDF per panel. This is what the scripts
  produce and what the site displays.
- `output/` — accompanying tables (specificity scores, QC summaries,
  per-study annotation rates).
- `docs/` — the built site.
- `data/` — **not tracked in git**; see below.

## Data

The inputs are ~3.9 GB of Seurat objects and cached intermediates, deposited on
Zenodo rather than in this repository:

**<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21839963>** — download `immgenT-Cosmo.zip`.

Unpack it at the repository root so that the `data/` directory sits next to
`script/` and `analysis/`:

```
unzip immgenT-Cosmo.zip -d /path/to/immgenT-cosmo-paper
```

You should end up with `data/immgenT_seurat_ADT_GeneSubset.Rds` and the other
28 input files. The scripts read `data/` as a relative path and are run from
the repository root, so the location matters. Every file, what reads it and
where it comes from is listed in the data provenance table in
`code/README.md`.

Two conventions in that data are worth knowing before reading any script:

- **RNA in `immgenT_seurat_ADT_GeneSubset.Rds` is already log-normalised.** It
  had to be, because log-normalisation divides by each cell's total counts over
  all genes and the object is gene-subsetted. No figure script normalises its
  RNA assay again.
- **ADT is deliberately not normalised.** Each panel that plots protein
  normalises the exact set of cells it gates, so that a threshold means the
  same thing throughout a panel.

## Reproducing a figure

```
Rscript script/Figure4.R          # writes figures/Figure 4/*.pdf
Rscript script/render_site_assets.R   # converts panels to the site's PNGs
```

then `workflowr::wflow_build()` to rebuild the pages. The code on each page is
displayed, not re-executed at build time, so building the site does not require
the data.

## License

MIT (see `LICENSE`). The bundled JavaScript libraries under `docs/site_libs/`
are third-party and carry their own licences.

## Requirements

R 4.4 with Seurat 5, and [`ZemmourLib`](https://github.com/dzemmour/ZemmourLib)
— an internal package providing the immgenT colour palettes
(`immgent_colors`), the highlight and density plotting helpers
(`MyDimPlotHighlight`, `MyDimPlotHighlightDensity`, `MyFeatureScatter`) and the
pre-rendered lineage MDE backgrounds (`AddEmbeddingRasterBackground`) that
several panels draw over. The remaining dependencies are on CRAN and
Bioconductor: dplyr, tidyr, tibble, purrr, rlang, forcats, reshape2, ggplot2,
ggrepel, ggalluvial, scales, scattermore, pheatmap, ComplexHeatmap, circlize,
RColorBrewer, pals, viridis, cluster, RANN, magick.

`script/render_site_assets.R` additionally needs Ghostscript on `PATH`
(`brew install ghostscript`). Each page's exact session is recorded in the
session information block at the foot of the built page.
